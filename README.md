# Five Emerging Trends for the Future of the Software Development

As someone who loves trends, I really enjoyed [Five Emerging Trends for the Future of the Software Development](https://hackernoon.com/five-changes-that-are-coming-to-the-software-development-industry-with-the-future-of-work-636ef725cb1c) by Isabel Nyo.

Unlike other articles on the topic, this article describes the trends not only from a technical perspective, but also from a working style perspective. Isabel defines 5 main trends:

- Rise in demand for generalists over specialists
- Increase in importance of collaboration
- Globalization and its impact on software engineering
- Career path is becoming less linear
- The most successful will be self-starters rather than passive rule followers

For each trend, the article presents practical statistics and shows why it matters to software engineers. For instance, the increased demand for full stack developers is a sign that generalists are becoming more commonplace as opposed to specialists. She also suggests that in the future, good software engineers have to be flexible, be more collaborative and have a more global mindset. Finally, the article a statistic that was particularly thought provoking

- **60% of new jobs in the 21th century will require skills that only 20% currently possess.**

## Luis comments

"I was born to academic parents and growing up, obtaining academic qualifications have always been at the top of my life goals. As a result, I considered academic qualifications to be one of the important things to have in resumes. It wasnâ€™t until a decade into my career that I truly understood how important it is to have people who are collaborative and are team players than those who just excel in academics. They are not always mutually inclusive."

This particular part of the article really resonated with me, as I have persoanlly come to the same realization that the industry has shifted increasingly towards a need for "general purpose" engineers as opposed to engineers that specialize in one particular language or paradigm. The rapid growth of the industry is making this increasingly difficult to keep up with, making this field an infinite learning curve that only those who make this realization early will reap benefits from.
